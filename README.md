# Mobius

## Requirements

To get up and running you'll need some specific workspace tools, most of what you need should be installed or can be installed via this script https://github.com/Rafcin/CS1C/blob/main/tools.sh

- [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/ "Git Kraken")
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ "Figma")
- [QT Design Studio](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-released "QT Design Studio")
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/?gclid=CjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_nUPyt8CykMv7iFiZheXmYp3OlAWZf8CTS5MXTNdNzVc2MOTuLwepaRoC0EUQAvD_BwE "CLion") by Jetbrains
  Kraken will make it easier for the team members to track commits and view merges/cherrypick.
  QT Design Studio will help create designs and Figma will be used to prototype designs before they are built.
  CLion is optional, however the project was constructed using CLion. CLion also provides useful tools for rapid development and debugging.
